# Bank Deposit Subscription Predictor

This Streamlit app predicts whether a client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on various factors (e.g. personal, campaign-related data) using a trained Random Forest classifier.

## Project Overview

The project uses classification techniques to predict if a client will subscribe (`yes` or `no`) to a term deposit, based on factors such as age, job, marital status, balance, loan status, and campaign details. 
The machine learning model is trained with consideration of class imbalance using class weights.

## Features

- Streamlit web interface for inputting client data
- Real-time prediction
- Pretrained machine learning model using Random Forest
- Includes categorical feature encoding and engineered features
- Handles class imbalance with `class_weight='balanced'`

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

- Data Preprocessing
  - Encoding categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies`
  - Feature engineering: age groups, campaign efficiency, balance level, etc.
- Model Training
  - Random Forest Classifier with class weights
- Model Evaluation
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Export
  - Trained model saved using `joblib`
  - Feature list saved for prediction alignment
